Bad Tester JD:
We need someone to, like, make sure our stuff works. You'll be writing scripts, probably in something, and dealing with bugs. Must be a 'self-starter' (meaning we won't tell you what to do) and comfortable with 'fast-paced environments' (meaning chaos). Experience is a plus, but honestly, we're just looking for someone willing to learn...on the job...from us...eventually. Bonus points if you can fix the coffee machine.
